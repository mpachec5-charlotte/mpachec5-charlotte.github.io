            <h2>What is playing instruments as a hobby?</h2>
            <p>Music is an art form, and instruments are how you can harness that and create art through musical expression and performance. 
                Playing and performing music is a skill that you never truly master, 
                since there is always something new you are learning.
            </p>
            <p>There are various levels to playing and performing music, 
                but it is generally something that most people can pick up with consistent time and practice. 
                Learning can be tiresome in a classroom setting, but by playing different types of music from 
                different eras, you start to connect with the music and truly learn it.

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Emilio and I have played the Viola since 6th grade. For reference, 
                I am about to graduate college in a few semesters. I also play the piano, and own 
                a violin, recorder, and guitar.
            </p>
            <p>Some works I have performed and have really enjoyed are A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn), 
                Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven), Academic Festival Overture (Brahms), and 
                Humoresque, Op. 101, No. 7 (Dvořák).

            <h2>When is the best time to play music?</h2>
            <p>Whenever you want!</p>
            <p>For orchestra groups, such as a university orchestra, there tends to be a 
                general schedule where performances happen on certain months, and the time 
                leading up to that is spend rehearsing and learning the music. For other organizations, 
                there are also things like Christmas concerts or concerts themed around other seasons, 
                so you should expect presentations to happen around those times of year.
            </p>
            <p>On your own, you can and should play as much as possible. Frequent playing helps 
                with retaining and mastering your skills, and taking long breaks can lead to you 
                becoming "rusty" and needing to spend more time relearning what you have already done.

            <h2>Where should you play music?</h2>
            <p>Wherever you want!</p>
            <p>You can play your instrument in your house, outside, at a park, or 
                wherever you want, as long as it is respectful to those around you (i.e. don't play very loud 
                at night when your roommate is trying to sleep). If you are in an appropriate public setting, 
                you could play your music there to practice playing in front of others.
            </p>
            <p>If you need more peace and quiet, practice rooms are a great place to play music, 
                as they give you the space that you need to rehearse your music while keeping you in 
                an air-conditioned area and away from the elements, which can be damaging to your instrument.

            <h2>How do I start playing an instrument?</h2>
            <p>You can go to any music store and purchase or rent an instrument, and 
                take lessons there. If you want to save money, most family members or friends 
                usually have instruments they are no longer using, would be willing to teach 
                you how to play an instrument, or know someone who is willing to teach you.
            </p>
            <p>The key to learning anything is time, patience, and consistency. You aren't going to 
                pick up an instrument and suddenly be able to play a symphony. You will have to start with 
                the fundamentals and work your way up, but if you are consistent and pushing yourself, 
                you will be able to play moderately well sooner than you think.

            <h2>Why play an instrument?</h2>
            <p>Studies point to music in general being relaxing and calming, and being good for the brain. 
                It stimulates multiple regions of the brain, and helps with memory and mental health. It can also 
                be a creative or emotional outlet, and allow you to be more productive. There is also a large 
                community of musicians that you can connect with.
            </p>
            <p>I personally play instruments because everyone in my family has, and I have been exposed to it from a young age. 
                My sister played the violin when she was in middle school, and my mom played the clarinet when 
                she was younger. When I started middle school, I was excited to play the violin, but they had a lot of violin 
                players already so I was given a viola, and have stuck with it ever since.
